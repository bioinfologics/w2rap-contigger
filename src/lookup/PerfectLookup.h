/**
   \file

// Given a vector "query" of sequences, find all perfect alignments
// to target (defined by "lookup_file", from MakeLookupTable with the given "K"),
// where the default behaviour is that the alignment is required to go end-to-end
// on the query.  Queries of length < K are not aligned. The option "direction"
// specifies whether only forward alignments are to be found, or if reverse
// alignments are to be found too.  Output is "aligns".
//
// If the flag subsumed_only is set to False, then partial alignments will also be
// found using the same low kmer freq method described below. This does NOT return
// all possible partial alignments, just those 'seeded' by the low frequency kmer
// positions in the target. However, if a set of overlapping target basevectors
// are used, with a fixed overlap (in bases) given in target_seq_overlap, then all
// the partial alignments for each overlap region WILL be found. For example, if
// the target was created from a hyperbasevector, then all possible alignments of
// the query sequences to the hyperbasevector will be found. The value of the
// target_seq_overlap in this case would be K-1 (wherre K is for the associated
// hyperkmerpath, not the lookup table).
//
// Note that for certain applications, the code be speeded up by keeping the
// lookup table in memory, rather than reading it from disk on each call.
//
// Method: for each query sequence, we find a kmer in it that appears a minimal
// number of times in the target.  Each occurrence of this kmer in the target
// defines a possible offset, which we test directly.
//
// I'm not sure how this handles Ns in the target.
//
// WARNING: this code will return duplicate alignments.
